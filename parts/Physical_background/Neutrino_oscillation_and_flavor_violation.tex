Neutrino oscillation was experimentally confirmed in 1998 by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Japan, which observed the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos. This discovery provided strong evidence that neutrinos have mass and that they can change flavors as they propagate through space. Subsequent experiments, such as the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Canada and the KamLAND experiment in Japan, further confirmed neutrino oscillations by studying solar and reactor neutrinos, respectively.
